# Data input

* units to add: counts or cps, g, 
* elements: LE
* LOI *must* be provided as concentration
* Elements for elements, oxides for oxides, followed by _<unit>; principally currently defined patterns
* Conversion between oxides and elements; consider environment (oxidising/reducing) through switch in conversion function
* Recommendation on metadata columns, check for other obligatory metadata in the function where they are needed
* analytical precision: _err2SD, _errSD, _errSD%, _errSD%, _errSE, _err2SE, including switch in read in function if all errors are the same (e.g. error = "2SD")
* Create identifier columns with name "ID", if not create inside <filename><rownumber>, input argument to specify which column in ID column
* Identify and flag missing values as warning, specifying exact location
* Summary of the read-in results
* Metadata columns are specified to recognise typos etc. in column headers


# Handling bdl values
* identifier for bdl values + value to what it should be replaced with
* should be feature of the as. function

# Data validation/checking
* Concentration way beyond analytical precision: with argument taking threshold expressed as multiples of analytical precision: warning
* Duplicates (ID and/or if entire rows are the same): Flag as warning
* Concentrations are reasonably constrained with argument taking min+max threshold and default value: warning

* check potential function in robcompositions (and elsewhere)
