#' Standard Sample Bracketing
#'
#' @description
#' Performs Standard Sample Bracketing (SSB) correction for isotope ratio data.
#'
#' @details
#' This function corrects for instrumental drift or mass bias during isotopic analyses.
#' The measured isotope value of each sample is linearly interpolated between the two standard measurements taken immediately before and after the sample measurement
#'
#' @param df Data frame containing isotope data. It must include at least two columns: one with sample IDs and another with isotope ratios, ordered according to the sequence of analysis.
#' @param ID_std Character string indicating the ID of the standard used for bracketing.The same ID must be used consistently throughout the column.
#' @param pos Integer indicating the row position of the first standard in the bracketing sequence.
#'
#' @references
#' <include here any relevant literature references>
#'
#' @returns
#' This function is a useful tool for automating a common practice in handling isotope data. It reduces the likelihood of human error and saves time.
#'
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
#' <write here any example code. These are small simple examples on how to use
#' the function or to highlight specific features>

  if std=="":
