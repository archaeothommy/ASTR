# Debugging & testing in R

- Some practical advice how to (1) debug R code and how to (2) use testing in R package development.

## Debugging

- See faulty function `testfun` in test.R
- Build the package
- Run with `ASTR::testfun(3)`to demonstrate how the function fails

With the debugger:

- Set debug flags, rebuild the package
- Run again and use the debugger

Interactive:

- Set input variables in global environment `x <- 3`
- Run the function with the REPL
