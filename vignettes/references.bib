  abstract="Lead isotope analysis has been used to provenance metals such as lead, silver and bronze for many decades. Different approaches to interpret lead isotope ratios were proposed, and various limitations of the method have been discussed and addressed. Overlap in composition between different possible ore sources is always mentioned as a major limitation in lead isotope studies. However, it has never been comprehensively studied using a multivariate statistical approach. In this paper, the kernel density estimation (KDE) approach previously proposed by the authors is applied to calculate overlap between possible ore source regions. Firstly, the copper and lead ores of the same regions are compared, to assess if they are consistent and thus can be combined to increase sample size for provenance studies. Secondly, the pair-wise overlap between all the mining regions is calculated to determine if the distinction can actually be made between those ore fields. The use of one-dimensional KDE's is very effective for calculation and assessment of the overlap between ore sources. This study argues that merging the lead and copper ore data might increase the reliability of a region's KDE's in most cases, but the overlap should be assessed beforehand. Furthermore, the study provides useful tools to verify for every pair of possible ore sources if it is theoretically possible to discriminate between them, and to what extent.",

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to apply kernel density estimates (KDEs) to the visualization and interpretation of lead isotope data from bronze assemblages found along the northern border of central China, here designated as the Arc. New lead isotope analyses of 30 leaded tin–bronze artefacts from the Wangdahu cemetery (c.500–300 bc) in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, north-west China, provide the basis for the discussion. By using multivariate KDEs and the calculated likelihood of the overlap, the present work shows that the Wangdahu objects feature a unique linear array of isotope ratios, representing an important element of overall bronzes from the Arc in the first millennium bc. This characteristic isotope signature is fundamentally different from that of Dajing ores in north-east China, as well from that of early Qin bronzes in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. This suggests that a variety of metal resources were utilized by peoples living in the Arc. The KDE approach thus proves effective at presenting and comparing lead isotope data.},

  abstract = {Summary Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) have found wide application in archaeological spatial analysis, where they have been integrated into geographical information systems with various user-friendly packages to explore the spatial distribution of archaeological finds. The creation of a KDE provides a non-parametric way of converting continuous data such as histograms or scatter plots into a smoothed probability density function, which allows inferences to be made about the population distribution based on a given sample of data. The open-access software, developed by Christopher Bronk Ramsey for producing and comparing KDE distributions of glass chemistry in volcanic tephra, can be used to generate KDEs and test for overlaps. The earliest application of KDE in archaeological chemistry was in relation to the interpretation of lead isotope data. Trace element analysis can be used to infer the source of the raw materials used to produce glass.}

abstract="Kernel smoothers are essential tools for data analysis due to their ability to convey complex statistical information with concise graphical visualisations. Their inclusion in the base distribution and in the many user-contributed add-on packages of the R statistical analysis environment caters well to many practitioners. Though there remain some important gaps for specialised data, most notably for tidy and geospatial data. The proposed eks package fills in these gaps. In addition to kernel density estimation, this package also caters for more complex data analysis situations, such as density derivative estimation, density-based classification (supervised learning) and mean shift clustering (unsupervised learning). We illustrate with experimental data how to obtain and to interpret the statistical visualisations for these kernel smoothing methods.",
