\usage{
element_to_oxide(
  df,
  elements,
  oxide_preference,
  which_concentrations = c("all", "major", "minor", "no_trace"),
  normalise = FALSE,
  drop = FALSE
)

oxide_to_element(df, oxides, normalise = FALSE, drop = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame with compositional data.}

\item{elements, oxides}{Character vector with the chemical symbols of the
elements or oxides that should be converted.}

\item{oxide_preference}{String that controls which oxide should be used if an
element forms more than one oxide. Allowed values are: \code{reducing},
\code{oxidising}, \code{ask}, or a named vector mapping the specific oxide to its
element. See details for further information.}

\item{which_concentrations}{Character string that determines by concentration
which of the \code{elements} or \code{oxides} are converted. Allowed values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{all} (convert all elements; the default)
\item \code{major} (convert elements with concentrations >= 1 wt\%)
\item \code{minor} (convert elements with concentrations between 0.1 and 1 wt\%).
\item \code{no_trace} (convert elements with concentration >=0.1 wt\%)
}}

\item{normalise}{If \code{TRUE}, converted concentrations will be normalised to
100\%. Default to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{drop}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, columns with unconverted values are
kept. If \code{TRUE}, columns with unconverted values are dropped. Dropping
column could result in loss of information as this will also drop
columns with values excluded from conversion by the parameter
\code{which_concentrations}.}

\value{
The original data frame with the converted concentrations
}
\description{
Convert between element and oxide weight percent (oxide\%) compositions using
pre-compiled conversion factors.
}
\details{
If the dataset includes already an element and its respective oxide,
the conversion leaves the column of the respective oxide or element
unaffected.

In \code{element_to_oxide()}, the parameter \code{oxide_preference} controls the
behaviour of the function if the element forms more than one oxide:
\itemize{
\item \code{oxidising}: Use the oxide with the highest oxidation state of the element
(e.g., \code{Fe2O3})
\item \code{reducing}: Use the oxide with the lowest oxidation state of the element
(e.g., \code{FeO})
\item \code{ask}: The user is asked for each element which oxide should be used.
\item named vector: A named vector mapping the oxides to be used to the
elements (e.g., \code{c(Fe = "FeO", Cu = "Cu2O")})
}

In \code{oxide_to_element()}, conversions from different oxides to the same
element (e.g., Fe\if{html}{\out{<sub>}}2\if{html}{\out{</sub>}}O\if{html}{\out{<sub>}}3\if{html}{\out{</sub>}} and FeO to Fe) result in one column for the element
with the sum of all converted values of the respective element.

Conversion factors are pre-compiled for a wide range of oxides.
consequently, conversion is restricted to the oxides on this list. If you
encounter an oxide that is currently not included, please reach out to the
package maintainers or create a pull request in the \href{https://github.com/archaeothommy/ASTR}{package's GitHub repo} to add it.

\examples{
# Example data frame with element weight percents
df <- data.frame(Si = 45, Fe = 10, Cr = 2)

# Convert elements to oxides using oxidising preference
element_to_oxide(df, elements = c("Si", "Fe", "Cr"), oxide_preference = "oxidising")

# Convert elements to oxides using reducing preference
element_to_oxide(df, elements = c("Si", "Fe", "Cr"), oxide_preference = "reducing")

# Manually specify which oxide to use for each element
element_to_oxide(df, elements = c("Fe", "Cr"), oxide_preference = c(Fe = "FeO", Cr = "Cr2O3"))

# Preserve original element columns
element_to_oxide(df, elements = c("Si", "Fe", "Cr"), oxide_preference = "oxidising", drop = FALSE)
